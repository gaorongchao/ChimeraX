Chimera-icon.ai is the original Chimera icon designed by Heidi Houtkooper.
The current Chimera icon is from Jessen Bredeson, and it is Heidi's icon
with drop shadows and was contributed back via the chimera-users mailing list.

ChimeraX-icon.svg started with Heidi's original Adobe Illustrator (.ai) file,
then added a X from the URW Chancery L font, converted the 'X' to a path, and
added drop shadows.

To add an X with drop shadows to the Chimera icon:

1) run inkscape from inkscape.org and open Chimera-icon.ai
   (Heidi's original Chimera version)
2) use the text mouse mode to place an X and select it
3) use the Text and Font tool to change the font and font size,
   eg., UIRW Chancery L and 400
4) use the selection mouse mode to position X where you want it
5) use the Fill and Stroke tool to set the color of the X
6) use Object to Path convert X from a character to a path
   (since systems using ChimeraX might not have the same font installed)
7) use the Drop Shadows filter separately on the original icon and the X
   (radius 4.5, horizontal offset 8 px, vertical offset 8 px for X,
   -8 for original icon)
8) save

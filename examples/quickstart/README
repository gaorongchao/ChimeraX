Sample code for creating menu items and commands that open
a web page in the help viewer.  This is particularly useful
for sites that have pages with "cxcmd" commands for executing
ChimeraX commands in a session.

To customize the code for a different site/command, edit:

bundle_info.xml

	1. Change the "name" and "package" attributes of
   	   the "BundleInfo" element to match your application.
	2. Change the "Author", "Email" and "URL" to match
	   your information.
	3. Change the "Synopsis" and "Description" elements
	   to match your application.
	4. Change the "ChimeraXClassifier" elements for
	   "Tool" and "Command" to match your application.
	   The "Tool" classifier adds the menu entry.
	   The "Command" classifier adds the command.
	   Either may be removed if you do not need/want it.

src/__init__.py

	1. Change "_URL" to point to your web page.
	2. Change "_Synopsis" to match the synopsis for the
	   command.
	3. If you removed the "Tool" classifier in bundle_info.xml,
	   remove (or comment out) the "start_tool" method.
	4. If you removed the "Command" classifier in bundle_info.xml,
	   remove (or comment out) the "register_command" method.

To test:

	If you have the "make" command, just type:

		make CHIMERAX_APP=path_to_ChimeraX.app install

	If you do not have "make", start ChimeraX and run the command:

		dev install path_to_this_directory
